Responsive storefront built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. Products come from Platzi's fake store API and state is managed through the shared shopping-cart context.

## Personalize it

Use the new `src/config/personalization.js` file to surface your own branding across the UI.

1. **App identity** – set `appName` and `contactEmail` to update the navbar brand and contact info.
2. **Profile** – fill the `owner` object to update the My Account page with your avatar, headline, and social links.
3. **Visuals** – replace `public/ShoppingIcon.svg` and drop your own screenshots into `README.md` (see the placeholders below).
4. **Copy** – search the source for "Your Storefront" or `personalization` to tweak any remaining defaults.
